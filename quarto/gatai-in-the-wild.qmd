## Interacting with the GUI

In the previous chapters we have abstracted the game and trained models on theoretical abstractions. While the monte-carlo simulations we conducted showed encouraging results, we have still not provided evidence that Gatai would be able to play this game in the real worlds. In order for us to interact with the real-world game console we either need to obtain the game's source code and interact through the *Unity* platform, or else interact through its graphical user interface (GUI).

As we did not have access to the source code, we were left with the latter option: interacting with the GUI. This avenue presented us with some additional challenges, most of which are, incidentally, solvable by applying artificial intelligence.
