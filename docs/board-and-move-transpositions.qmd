## Board and Move Transpositions

```{r}
#| include: false
library(xmas3)

```

Since the strategies and tactics learned on a i.e. 3x4 board are in principle the same as those of a 4x3 board it is useful to be able to transpose both boards and moves. We therefore implemented transpose-functions for both.

## Examples

```{r}
B <- xmas3board(2051,c(3,4))
my_move <- "A1 to B1"

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-transpositions
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| fig-cap: "Transposition example"
#| fig-subcap: ["Original","Transposed"]
#| fig-asp: 1
#| fig-width: 3
B %>% plot() %>% add_move(my_move)
transpose(B) %>% plot() %>% add_move(my_move %>% transpose_move())

```
