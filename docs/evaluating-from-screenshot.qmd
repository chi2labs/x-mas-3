```{r}
#| include: false
library(xmas3)
model_path <- here::here("inst","models","q-learning-3x5.rds")
gatai <- readr::read_rds(model_path)
```

In order to connect Gatai with the real interface it is necessary to read and interpret a screenshot. For this purpose the `screenshot_translate_board` function was created.

Getting a screenshot.

```{r}
filename <- "../inst/screenshots-mac/screenshot-2023-08-3-14.png"
Board <- xmas3::screenshot_load_scale_and_crop(filename)
    M <- screenshot_translate_board(Board)
```

We now have:

```{r}
M %>% knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
my_eval <- xfun::cache_rds(
  evaluate_board(B = M, model = gatai, dims = c(3,5))
)
```
