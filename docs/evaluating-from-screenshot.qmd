In order to connect Gatai with the real interface it is necessary to read and interpret a screenshot. For this purpose the `screenshot_translate_board` function was created.

Getting a screenshot.

```{r}
filename <- "../inst/screenshots-mac/screenshot-2023-08-3-14.png"
Board <- xmas3::screenshot_load_scale_and_crop(filename)
    M <- screenshot_translate_board(Board)
```

We now have:

```{r}
M %>% knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
my_eval <- evaluate_board_LUT(M, dims=c(3,5))

```

```{r}
my_eval |> dplyr::filter(expected_value>0) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```
